test_program1.asm
    1. loads numbers into $t0-$t3
    2. multiplys $t0 and $t1 and stores that number in $t3
    3. multiplys $t3 and $t2 and stores that number in $t3
    4. moves $t3 into $a0
    5. initiates print int, prints it as it was already placed in $a0
    6. ends the program

test_program2.asm
    1. loads data1, data2 and data3 as word values
    2. loads those data values into $t0-$t3 accordingly
    3. multiplys $t0 and $t1 and stores that number in $t3
    4. multiplys $t3 and $t2 and stores that number in $t3
    5. moves $t3 into $a0
    6. initiates print int, prints it as it was already placed in $a0
    7. ends the program
